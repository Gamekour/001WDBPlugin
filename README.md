# SCP-001 (When Day Breaks)

![001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49810363/131126449-90b169fe-f612-45ea-9356-4242380ad17c.jpg)

This is a plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory which adds S. D. Locke's
SCP-001 proposal (When Day Breaks) to the game,
whether it be an event based on a chance(in the config)
or always enabled.

In short, anyone who is not either 
A. an MTF(or chaos if enabled in config)
B. wearing heavy armor
C. an SCP

Will turn into a zombie(001-A instance)
upon entering surface zone.
(if its called 001-1 then oops)

There are also some major changes to the
respawn system, as chaos do not get spawn 
tickets normally anymore. A setting to enable
chaos respawns will be supported in the future.

Instead, the warhead lever must be activated to send out
an emergency broadcast, granting the MTF tickets.

These MTF are guaranteed to spawn after 2 minutes from the broadcast,
and are equipped with spare heavy armor to allow those inside the facility
leave safely without becoming zombies.

Additionally, there's a chance these MTF can instead spawn as an SCP-100-A wave,
in which everyone is replaced with SCP-001-A instances upon spawning.
(The chances of this happening can be edited in the config)
